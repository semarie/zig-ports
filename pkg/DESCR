Zig is a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for
maintaining robust, optimal, and reusable software.

- Simple Language

Focus on debugging your application rather than debugging your
programming language knowledge.

No hidden control flow.

No hidden memory allocations.

No preprocessor, no macros.

- Comptime

A fresh approach to metaprogramming based on compile-time code
execution and lazy evaluation.

Call any function at compile-time.

Manipulate types as values without runtime overhead.

Comptime emulates the target architecture.

- Performance Meets Safety

Write fast, clear code capable of handling all error conditions.

The language gracefully guides your error handling logic.

Configurable runtime checks help you strike a balance between
performance and safety guarantees.

Take advantage of vector types to express SIMD instructions portably.
